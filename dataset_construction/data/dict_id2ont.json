When one or more of the adversaries request that another party plays the role of a mediator, this is understood to be a commitment on their part to accept mediation and is thus coded as 038. The target can either be a potential mediator (whose mediation is being requested) or one of the adversaries (who is requested to allow involvement of mediators).",

        "name": "Engage in mass expulsion",
        "description": "Force large groups of people or populations out of some territory.",
        "usage notes": "Note that this event form is different from expulsions of diplomats and international or non-governmental groups (166), and legal deportations (174). Mass expulsions coded here are typically carried out with the intention of clearing out a particular group of people out of a specific area.",
        "example": "The Israeli army forced out on Wednesday more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees from their homes in a West Bank refugee camp during a 48-hour search for militants, residents said."

        "name": "Engage in mass killings",
        "description": "Kill a substantial number of people, typically with the intention of ridding a territory of a particular group of people.",
        "usage notes": "Politically motivated mass killings and genocides are coded here, relying primarily on the specific terminology used by reporters to identify an event that involves 'mass' killings.",
        "example": "Sudan's government is responsible for mass killings and other atrocities in the Darfur region, according to a United Nations report."

        "id": "203",
        "name": "Engage in ethnic cleansing",
        "description": "Use mass expulsions and or mass killings targeting a specific ethnic group.",
        "usage notes": "When a report identifies mass expulsions or mass killings as being motivated by ethnic cleansing, use this code instead. The only way we can code ethnic cleansings as such is only if reporters use that particular terminology; therefore, we will need to rely on careful analysis of our event data, whereby we would focus on particular dyads, to reliably measure ethnic cleansings.",
        "example": "Serb forces were engaged in ethnic cleansing in Kosovo against the majority Albanian population of the province, according to the US government."
